This is a repo containing the results of my final project for a course I took at UMass Amherst ("Text as Data"). The results are shown in [poster.pdf](https://github.com/willjobs/public-comments-project/blob/main/poster.pdf), and milestone blog posts are in the [blogposts](https://github.com/willjobs/public-comments-project/tree/main/blogposts) folder. 

There are only a couple commits because it was moved out of the repo at https://github.com/willjobs/regulations-public-comments, which is where the Python wrapper now lives, and I wanted to have a separation of concerns.
